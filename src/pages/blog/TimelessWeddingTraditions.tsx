            <p>Indian weddings are not just ceremonies; they are grand celebrations of culture, family, and spirituality. Known for their vibrancy, emotional depth, and elaborate rituals, Indian weddings beautifully blend tradition with joy. Whether you're attending your first Indian wedding or planning your own, understanding these timeless traditions can help you appreciate the cultural richness behind each ritual.</p>

            <p>In this article, we'll explore the most important Indian wedding traditionsâ€”from pre-wedding customs to post-wedding celebrationsâ€”along with their cultural meanings and modern adaptations.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-4 mt-8">Pre-Wedding Traditions</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">1. Roka & Engagement Ceremony</h3>
            <p>The Roka marks the official start of wedding celebrations. It's a simple yet significant ritual where both families exchange gifts, sweets, and blessings. The engagement follows, where the bride and groom exchange rings.</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Modern Twist:</strong> Many couples now host engagement parties with themes, music, and fusion cuisines while still honoring traditional blessings.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">2. Haldi Ceremony</h3>
            <p>Held a day or two before the wedding, the Haldi ceremony involves applying a paste of turmeric, sandalwood, and rosewater on the bride and groom's face and body. It symbolizes purification, prosperity, and a natural glow.</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ SEO Tip:</strong> If you're searching for "haldi decoration ideas," you'll notice marigold flowers and yellow drapes trending in 2024.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">3. Mehendi Ceremony</h3>
            <p>The bride's hands and feet are decorated with intricate henna designs. Mehendi is not just about beautyâ€”it represents joy, prosperity, and love. Families celebrate with music, dance, and colorful outfits.</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact:</strong> Darker mehendi color is traditionally believed to signify deeper love and affection between the couple.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">4. Sangeet Night</h3>
            <p>Once a small family affair, the Sangeet has become one of the most fun-filled wedding events. Both families come together to sing, dance, and celebrate love. It strengthens family bonds and sets the tone for the big day.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-4 mt-8">Wedding Day Rituals</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">5. Baraat (Groom's Procession)</h3>
            <p>The groom arrives at the wedding venue with a lively procession called the Baraat. Accompanied by music, dance, and dhol beats, it symbolizes the groom's journey to unite with his bride.</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Modern Update:</strong> Many grooms now arrive on vintage cars, decorated horses, or even bikes instead of the traditional ghodi (horse).</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">6. Jaimala (Exchange of Garlands)</h3>
            <p>The bride and groom exchange floral garlands, symbolizing acceptance of each other as partners. This light-hearted ritual often sparks playful moments, as friends lift the groom to make it challenging for the bride to place the garland.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">7. Kanyadaan (Giving Away the Bride)</h3>
            <p>One of the most emotional rituals, Kanyadaan is performed by the bride's parents, symbolizing their trust in the groom to take care of their daughter. It represents the union of two families.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">8. Mangal Pheras (Sacred Vows Around the Fire)</h3>
            <p>The couple walks around the sacred fire (Agni) seven times, each round signifying a vowâ€”such as love, respect, fidelity, and prosperity. The pheras are the most important ritual, making the marriage official in Hindu tradition.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">9. Sindoor & Mangalsutra</h3>
            <p>The groom applies sindoor (vermillion) to the bride's hair parting and ties the mangalsutra (sacred necklace) around her neck. These mark the bride's new marital status.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-4 mt-8">Post-Wedding Traditions</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">10. Vidaai (Farewell Ceremony)</h3>
            <p>An emotional moment where the bride bids farewell to her family and leaves for her new home. Traditionally, she throws back handfuls of rice to signify prosperity and gratitude.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">11. Griha Pravesh (Welcoming the Bride)</h3>
            <p>At the groom's house, the bride is welcomed with an aarti and asked to gently kick a pot of rice at the entranceâ€”symbolizing abundance and good fortune entering the new home.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">12. Reception Party</h3>
            <p>The reception is the couple's first public appearance as husband and wife. Families and friends gather to bless the couple, often with music, dance, and a grand feast.</p>
