            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-4">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In Indian culture, the home is considered sacredâ€”a place where family, tradition, and spirituality meet. That's why home ceremonies (griha sanskar & pujas) play such a vital role in preserving customs and creating a bond between generations. From housewarming pujas to naming ceremonies, Satyanarayan puja, and festival celebrations, every ritual carries deep cultural and spiritual significance.</p>

            <p>In this guide, we'll explore the most popular Indian home ceremonies, their meanings, and how they are performed today.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-4 mt-8">Popular Indian Home Ceremonies</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">1. Griha Pravesh (Housewarming Ceremony)</h3>
            <p>When a family moves into a new home, the Griha Pravesh ritual is performed to purify the space and invite positive energy. Priests conduct mantras, the family enters with a coconut, and the lady of the house kicks a pot of rice for prosperity.</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Modern Tip:</strong> Eco-friendly dÃ©cor, rangolis with flower petals, and simple vegetarian feasts are trending for housewarming pujas in 2024.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">2. Satyanarayan Puja</h3>
            <p>One of the most common and significant home pujas, the Satyanarayan Puja is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. It is performed to seek blessings for health, wealth, and happiness.</p>
            
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-2">How it's performed:</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>A Kalash (sacred pot) is placed and decorated.</li>
              <li>Lord Vishnu's idol or photo is worshipped.</li>
              <li>Devotees recite the Satyanarayan Katha.</li>
              <li>Prasad (usually sheera or halwa) is distributed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰</strong> This puja is often performed during marriages, housewarming, birthdays, or before embarking on a new journey.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">3. Naamkaran (Naming Ceremony)</h3>
            <p>Held 11 or 12 days after a baby's birth, this ceremony introduces the newborn to the family and community. The priest consults the baby's horoscope to suggest auspicious letters for the name.</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Modern Twist:</strong> Parents often combine traditional rituals with creative themesâ€”like personalized decorations, baby photo booths, and customized keepsakes.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">4. Annaprashan (First Rice-Eating Ceremony)</h3>
            <p>Performed when the baby is 6 months old, Annaprashan marks the child's first solid food intake. The ceremony is done with prayers, blessings, and offerings of kheer (sweet rice pudding).</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ SEO Keyword:</strong> "Annaprashan ceremony significance" is a growing search term among young parents.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">5. Upanayan (Sacred Thread Ceremony)</h3>
            <p>A traditional Hindu rite of passage for boys, Upanayan introduces the child to spiritual learning. The boy is given the sacred thread (yajnopavita) and taught the Gayatri Mantra by a priest.</p>
            <p>Though less common today, it remains a respected ritual in many families.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-3">6. Shraddha & Pitru Paksha Rituals</h3>
            <p>Indian families also perform ancestral rites (Shraddha) to honor forefathers and seek their blessings. These ceremonies include offerings of food, water, and prayers for peace to departed souls.</p>
            <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ SEO Boost:</strong> People often search for "how to perform Shraddha at home" â€” adding step-by-step guidance helps your blog rank.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-ceremonial-maroon mb-4 mt-8">Everyday Home Pujas</h2>
            <p>Apart from big occasions, many Indian families perform small rituals regularly:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
